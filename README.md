### Key Components

- **Transcript Extraction**: YouTube transcripts are extracted using YouTube Transcript API
- **Translation System**: CrewAI agents handle translation with contextual awareness
- **Context-Aware Processing**: 
  - Large texts are split into 500-word chunks for efficient processing
  - Each segment uses a 100-word context window for accurate translation
- **Audio Generation**: Edge TTS converts translated text to natural-sounding speech
- **Caching System**: Processed segments are stored for future requests

### Chrome Extension

- The extension provides a user interface overlay for YouTube videos, allowing users to interact with the translation and language learning features
- Features a popup interface that detects when users are on a YouTube video page
- Includes buttons for fetching english transcript, creating real-time translations, and generating summary and notes
- Implements a sync system that highlights transcript lines as the video plays, helping users follow along
- Contains a language selection form where users can specify their target language for translation
- Features an audio playback system that retrieves translated audio segments from the backend server and plays them in real time with the current video timestamp
- Implements proper error handling for various scenarios like missing transcripts or connectivity issues
- Caches transcript data locally to improve performance for repeated operations
- Requires proper permissions in the manifest file, including access to YouTube domains and scripting capabilities

### Supported Languages

The system supports translation and audio generation for multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and more.
